# Cliwant Brand Guidelines

This skill provides comprehensive brand guidelines for Cliwant to ensure consistent and correct brand representation across all media and communications.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Creating presentations, documents, or reports featuring Cliwant branding
- Designing marketing materials (digital or print)
- Developing web or mobile interfaces with Cliwant branding
- Writing content that mentions Cliwant (correct name notation)
- Creating co-branded materials with partner companies

## Core Brand Elements

### 1. Logo System

Cliwant has three logo variations with a clear usage hierarchy. **ALWAYS use the official logo files from the assets folder.**

**Logo Files Available:**
- `assets/brand_logo.png` - Primary horizontal logo
- `assets/icon_logo.png` - Standalone icon
- `assets/top_bottom_logo.png` - Vertical layout logo

**Logo Priority Order:**
1. **Brand Logo** (`brand_logo.png`) - PRIMARY, use first for all communications
2. **Top-Bottom Logo** (`top_bottom_logo.png`) - Use only when horizontal space is limited
3. **Icon Logo** (`icon_logo.png`) - Use only when both dimensions are constrained

**Logo Selection Decision Tree:**
- Horizontal space available? → Use Brand Logo
- Only vertical space? → Use Top-Bottom Logo
- Severely constrained space? → Use Icon Logo

**Logo Specifications:**
- Minimum size: 2mm (print) / 15px (screen)
- Clear space: Equal to the height of letter 'C' in CLIWANT
- Never use logo as inline text
- Maintain aspect ratio - never distort
- Always use PNG files from assets folder

**Critical Logo Rules:**
- **ALWAYS use official logo files from `assets/` folder - never recreate or modify**
- Never rotate or distort logos
- Do not change colors arbitrarily
- Do not add effects (shadows, outlines, gradients)
- Do not stretch or squash - maintain aspect ratio

For comprehensive logo guidelines including detailed usage rules, background treatments, and quality control checklist, see `references/logo_guidelines.md`.

### 2. Color System

**Primary Brand Colors:**
- **CLIWANT Purple**: #686FE8 (RGB: 104, 111, 232) - Primary brand color
- **CLIWANT Dark Blue**: #001376 (RGB: 0, 19, 118) - Secondary color
- **CLIWANT White**: #FFFFFF - For dark backgrounds

**Logo Color Selection by Background:**
- White/Light backgrounds → Standard logo (Purple + Dark Blue) [1ST PRIORITY]
- Dark backgrounds (below 30% brightness) → Standard logo
- Bright backgrounds (above 60% brightness) → White logo
- Complex/image backgrounds → White logo (position on lighter areas)
- Similar color backgrounds → White logo with alternate brand color for icon lines
- Medium brightness (30-50%) → Use with caution, test visibility

**Color Usage Rules:**
- Always use exact hex/RGB values
- Never use gradients on logo
- Never reduce opacity
- Test visibility on actual media before finalizing

For detailed color specifications and background-specific guidance, see `references/color_guide.md`.

### 3. Typography

**Headline Fonts** (Pretendard):
- Black, Extra Bold, Bold weights
- Use for titles and prominent text

**Body Text Fonts** (Pretendard):
- SemiBold, Medium, Regular, Light, ExtraLight, Thin weights
- Use for body copy and supporting text

Pretendard supports Korean, English, numbers, and special characters.

### 4. Brand Notation

**Brand Name in Copy:**
- Korean text: 클라이원트
- English text: CLIWANT (all caps)
- ❌ WRONG: "cliwant" (lowercase)
- ❌ WRONG: Using logo as text

**Corporate Name:**
- Official: 주식회사 클라이원트 / (주)클라이원트 / CLIWANT Inc.
- Communication: Can use same as brand name when legal designation not required

**Partner Brand Display:**
- Equal visual hierarchy
- Spacing: 6 diagonal lines of Cliwant icon logo
- Center-align on common baseline
- Adjust partner logo size for visual balance

## Workflow

When creating Cliwant brand materials:

1. **Load logo files from assets folder**:
   - Copy the appropriate logo file from `assets/` to your working directory
   - Use `brand_logo.png` for primary applications
   - Use `top_bottom_logo.png` for vertical layouts
   - Use `icon_logo.png` for space-constrained applications

2. **Determine logo type needed** based on space constraints:
   - Prefer Brand Logo (horizontal) whenever possible
   - Use alternatives only when space requires it
   - Follow the priority order: Brand > Top-Bottom > Icon

3. **Select appropriate logo color** based on background:
   - Check background brightness/complexity
   - Refer to color selection rules above
   - When in doubt, test visibility

   - Use #001376 for CLIWANT Dark Blue
   - Never approximate or modify colors

5. **Use Pretendard typography** with appropriate weights:
   - Headlines: Black, Extra Bold, or Bold
   - Body: SemiBold through Thin based on emphasis needed

6. **Write brand name correctly**:
   - Korean: 클라이원트
   - English: CLIWANT (all caps)

7. **Maintain clear space** around logos:
   - Minimum: Height of 'C' letter
   - Never let other elements invade this space

8. **Respect minimum sizes**:
   - Print: 2mm minimum
   - Screen: 15px minimum
