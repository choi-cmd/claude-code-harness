# Cliwant Logo Guidelines Reference

## Logo Assets Location

All official Cliwant logo files are stored in the `assets/` directory:
- `assets/brand_logo.png` - Primary horizontal logo (Brand Logo)
- `assets/icon_logo.png` - Standalone icon (Icon Logo)
- `assets/top_bottom_logo.png` - Vertical layout logo (Top-Bottom Logo)

**IMPORTANT**: Always use these official logo files. Never recreate or modify the logos.

## Logo System Overview

Cliwant has three official logo variations, each designed for specific use cases. All logos must be used according to the priority system to maintain consistent brand identity.

## 1. Brand Logo (Primary - Horizontal Layout)

### Visual Description
- **Icon Element**: Two diagonal checkmark stripes (purple and dark blue) with two vertical purple bars on the left
- **Wordmark**: "CLIWANT" in bold sans-serif typeface in dark blue
- **Layout**: Horizontal arrangement (icon left, wordmark right)
- **Symbolism**: Checkmark pattern represents "checking all items needed for bidding"

### File Location
`assets/brand_logo.png`

### Color Composition
- Left vertical bars: CLIWANT Purple (#686FE8)
- Diagonal stripes: CLIWANT Dark Blue (#001376)
- Wordmark: CLIWANT Dark Blue (#001376)

### Usage Priority
**1st Priority** - This is the DEFAULT logo for ALL communications

### When to Use

- Measurement: Use the 'C' height as your spacing unit

### Minimum Size Specifications

## Logo Selection Decision Tree

Use this decision tree to select the appropriate logo:

1. **Is horizontal space adequate?**
   - YES → Use **Brand Logo** (1st priority)
   - NO → Go to step 2

2. **Is vertical space adequate?**
   - YES → Use **Top-Bottom Logo** (2nd priority)
   - NO → Go to step 3

3. **Is this a severely space-constrained application?**
   - YES → Use **Icon Logo** (3rd priority)
   - NO → Reconsider layout or increase logo area

## Logo Variations by Background

### On White/Light Backgrounds
- Use standard color version (purple + dark blue)
- This is the most common and preferred application
- Ensures maximum brand recognition

### On Dark Backgrounds
- Use all-white version of the logo
- OR use standard colors if background is dark enough for contrast
- Test visibility before finalizing

### On Colored Backgrounds
- When background uses brand colors: Use white version
- When background uses contrasting colors: Use standard version
- Always test for adequate contrast (WCAG AA standard minimum)

### On Complex/Image Backgrounds
- Prefer white version for visibility
- Consider adding subtle background panel for logo clarity
- Position logo on less busy areas of the image
- Ensure sufficient contrast between logo and background
