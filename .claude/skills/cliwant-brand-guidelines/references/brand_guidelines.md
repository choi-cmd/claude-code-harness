# Cliwant Brand Guidelines Reference

## Brand Overview

Cliwant is an AI-based RFP (Request for Proposal) analysis solution that simplifies the bidding process. The brand tagline is "Make RFP Simple. No More Paperwork."

## 1. Logo System

### 1.1 Brand Logo (Primary)
- **Structure**: Horizontal layout combining icon and wordmark
- **Priority**: First priority for all communications - use independently as standard
- **Clear Space**: Minimum margin equal to the height of the letter 'C' in CLIWANT
- **Minimum Size**: 
  - Print: 2mm
  - Screen: 15px

### 1.2 Icon Logo
- **Design**: Checkmark pattern symbolizing "checking all items needed for bidding"
- **Usage**: Applied where space is constrained
- **Clear Space**: Same as brand logo
- **Minimum Size**: Same as brand logo
- **Note**: Do not prioritize over the primary brand logo

### 1.3 Top-Bottom Logo
- **Structure**: Vertical layout with icon on top, wordmark below
- **Usage**: Alternative layout for specific spatial requirements
- **Clear Space**: Same as brand logo
- **Minimum Size**: Same as brand logo

### Logo Usage Priority Order
1. **First Priority**: Brand Logo (horizontal) - Use for all communications, display independently
2. **Second Priority**: Top-Bottom Logo - Use only when horizontal space is limited
3. **Third Priority**: Icon Logo - Use only when both horizontal and vertical space is very limited

### Logo Incorrect Usage
Avoid these mistakes:
1. Changing logo colors arbitrarily
2. Rotating the logo
3. Distorting proportions (stretching/squashing)
4. Using lowercase "cliwant" instead of "CLIWANT"
5. Applying outlines or additional effects

## 2. Color System

- Use standard color logo (Purple + Dark Blue)
- Works well on dark images and backgrounds

**Logo on Bright Background (Brightness above 60%)**
- Use white logo version

**Logo on Complex/Similar Color Backgrounds (3rd Priority)**
- Use white logo
- If background color is similar to brand color, use white logo with different brand color for icon lines

2. Applying gradient effects to logo
3. Using unapproved color combinations
